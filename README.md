This GitHub repository hosts a research project focused on using machine learning techniques like neural networks, random forest classifiers, and linear regression to analyze large amounts of biochemical data. Our aim is to predict how molecules bind to target proteins, which is crucial for drug discovery efforts.

By applying these advanced algorithms, we're working to better understand how molecular structures interact with biological processes. Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to the development of new and more effective treatments for diseases.

This project is still ongoing therefore be aware that changes may be applied to the files in the future.

If any questions arise don't hesitate to reach out!
